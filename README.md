# IntershopCartfront

This Project was created as part of the code-challenge of Intershop. It implements a shopping-cart front. For further documentation, look at the comments in the typescript-files.

Note that I did not know any type of web development just one week ago, no js, no html, no css. 

As my first angular app, I am aware that this app is not very sophisticated, this should be seen as a demonstration of my ability to learn.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.2.
